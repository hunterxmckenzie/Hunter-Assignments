    <p><em><strong>I finally decided to utilize my case study as a means of occupying the existing structural arrangement of One Times Square.</strong></em> <br></br>As a building that was well-known worldwide as a cultural icon at 'the crossroads of the world' in Times Square, I believed it to be an intriguing building worthy of reinvention. With a mere 20% of its occupyable space being utilized, I saw One Times Square as an underutilized historical structure that needed a re-evaluation. </p>
    <br>    
    <p><em><strong> While not the easiest connection to formulate on my own, I soon figured out that the form of the tentacles themselves could be utilized to form arrangements.</strong></em></p>
    <br>
        <p><em> As a means of addressing the opioid crisis, from which the One's only resident, Wahlgreens, was held liable for in district court, I wanted to generate an interior economy that privately funded research into the crisis.</em></p> 
       <br>
        <p>I decided that the best way of doing this would be to generate 2 different spaces, one utilizing my case study in plan and the other in section. These spaces combined to become 'The One', a nightclub that operated at the highest point of the building with a view overlooking Times Square, and a research laboratory that operated in tandem with the building's pre-existing Wahlgreens. With this design, I attempted to finalize my case study as a realistic and viable tool for urban reform, particularly when examinining existing architectural and structural contexts.</p></li>
