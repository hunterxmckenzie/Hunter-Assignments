<p><em><strong>When considering how to design around existing conditions, is there an easier way to form our approach?</strong></em> <br></br>This was my main question as I approached my first semester at Columbia University, eager to step out of my comfort zone but unsure how to do so productively. I became enamored with the idea of mutual connection, a generation of space that sought to unify surrounding areas, communities and districts through a deep knowledge of context. </p>
<p><em><strong> It was late at night after one of my longest studio days, when it hit me.</strong></em> I was crawled up in bed, beginning to feel the first chills of winter while watching a documentary recommended to me by a friend. I watched videos of Octopi floating through the ocean, gliding and interacting with their environment. Absorbing, adapting...</p>
<p><em> Why can't a building do the same? Why can a design not act like an octopus would, absorbing and adapting to information presented to inform decisions?</em></p>
