    <p><em><strong>If an Octopus could be used to gauge spacial arrangements, how should its use be organized?</strong></em> <br></br>I had many other questions to answer while formulating my case study. It became necessary to engage in deep research about the anatomy of an octopus, as well as the human body, to draw my own parallels and generate a unique design approach. </p>
    <br>    
    <p><em><strong> While not the easiest connection to formulate on my own, I soon figured out that the form of the tentacles themselves could be utilized to form arrangements.</strong></em></p>
    <br>
        <p><em> Why couldn't the shape of a tentacle itself form hallways, walls, and other programmatic elements?</em></p> 
       <br>
        <p>I decided to employ this approach when completing my final proposal. I reviewed other examples of Octopi in modern media, as a means of gauging both the graphical complexities and understated nuances of modern studies of the Octopus. I re-watched such films as The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, in an attempt to replicate a similar admiration and intrigue in my work for the Octopus.</p></li>
